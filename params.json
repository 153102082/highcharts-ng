Currently only one x axis can be dynamically controlled.\r\n             //properties currentMin and currentMax provied 2-way binding to the chart's maximimum and minimum\r\n             xAxis: {\r\n              currentMin: 0,\r\n              currentMax: 20,\r\n              title: {text: 'values'}\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll properties on the chart configuration are optional. Each property is watched for changes by angularjs.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\n- Adding and removing series\r\n- Setting/Updating Chart options\r\n- Updating the chart title\r\n- 2 way binding to chart xAxis\r\n- Control of Loading status\r\n- Resizes with screen size changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets (this is solvable though...)\r\n- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice\r\n- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added\r\n- The 2 way binding to xAxis properties should be treated as experimental\r\n- When using with a highstocks navigator errors can occur\r\n- Needs tests!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlder Versions\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 0.0.1 (not compatible with currrent version)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n`<highchart id=\"chart1\" series=\"chart.series\" title=\"chart.title\" options=\"chart.options\"></highchart>`\r\n\r\nSee an example here: [http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/46rhz/](http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/46rhz/)\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\n- Adding and removing series\r\n- Setting/Updating Chart options\r\n- Updating the chart title\r\n\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets (this is solvable though...)\r\n- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice\r\n- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added\r\n- Needs tests!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
